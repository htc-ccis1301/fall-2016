  <h1 id="case-study-pacific-trails-resort---introduction">Case Study: Pacific Trails Resort - Introduction</h1>
<p>A case study project is a simulation that reflects the work you might encounter in a business or work environment.  This case study simulates the development of a business web site for the Pacific Trails Resort.  In addition to the materials in your textbook, I have created additional information as part of this module, to add to that experience.  This will simulate an agile project that works incrementally with the business customer to deliver the completed work.</p>

<p>In this agile project simulation, I will be your go-between with the actual business client.  I will handle getting the details on the site requirements and design worked out with Melanie, our client, while you handle the actual site development work. I will have regular check-ins with Melanie to present your completed work and to solidify the requirements for our next round of work. Each iteration of work will bring us closer to the final finished project.</p>

<h2 id="project-instructions">Project Instructions</h2>
<p>For each part of the case study, you should begin with the information on the course web site.  This will setup the work for this iteration of the project and make note of things that you should do differently from the instructions specified in the textbook. It is important to pay attention to these, as only <em><strong>my</strong></em> way is correct when it comes time to grade the work.  If you follow the book instructions instead of mine, you will lose points on the assignment. I recommend that you make notes on these differences on paper and refer to that as you work through the instructions from the book.</p>

<p>These changes are not meant to just irritate or confuse you. Most changes are intended to prevent you from doing something one way in one chapter’s instructions only to change it later. Because we are doing multiple chapters per part, this can be particularly annoying.  Other changes support more correct, semantic HTML or are intended to better mirror current industry best practices.</p>

<p>Please follow these instructions both here on the web and in the textbook carefully.  I mistake early on can haunt you weeks later when something else doesn’t work because it depends on the setup from the week before. This is also why it is important to read the feedback from the grading of your previous assignment on GitHub. Before beginning the next part of the work, it is important that you correct any issues with the earlier work.  Errors that are not fixed will continue to get reduced grades each week they remain an issue.</p>

<h2 id="github-project-repository">GitHub Project Repository</h2>
<p>The initial repository for this project can be found on our class organization page:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/cs-pacific-trails">cs-pacific-trails</a></p>

<p>You will only need to fork and clone this project once.  Then for each part of the assignment you will make changes, use Brackets Beautify to format your work, then do the git add, commit, and push to send the files to GitHub.  Then test your site running on the GitHub web site (find the URL under Settings), validate your page, and create the pull-request for grading.</p>

<img class="emoji" title=":warning:" alt=":warning:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"> Do not create a new folder as indicated at the start of each chapter's Case Study instructions in the textbook!  You should place your HTML files directly into the cloned repository folder.  Do not add a sub-folder for your HTML pages.
</div>

<h2 id="overall-tips">Overall Tips</h2>
<p>I will repeat these in the first part of the assignment, but after that I will assume that you will remember them on your own.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test often.  Do a section of work and test it thoroughly.  Remember to test things that may have worked before just to make sure they still work. Finding errors closer to the time they are made can help you remember what you might have done to cause them.</li>
  <li>Add/commit your changes locally as you complete a section of the work.  For example if you need to update two web pages, do one and test it, then do an add/commit to your local git repository.  Then update the second page, test it and do and add/commit again.  This gives you a recovery point for later on should you need it.</li>
  <li>If you do a lot of work, make sure to get it onto the GitHub site (add/commit/push) so that if something happens to your computer, you do not lose the work.  I will not be sympathetic to hearing that this is a problem (and neither would your boss at work).</li>
  <li>Test locally, and then repeat all of that testing on your published GitHub web site.  Do not just assume that it worked on your computer so it will work on the web too.  This is often not true, and the number one reason is link errors.  Make sure you use relative links and remember that the web server is case sensitive for file names.</li>
  <li>Beautify (with the Brackets Beautify Plugin) all of your files.  This will format them so that tags &amp; style rules indent nicely and are easy to read.  This is important to me, as the person grading your work, but also to you as it makes your work look clean and professional to anyone else who might come along and see it - like a potential employer you sent to GitHub to see what you can do.</li>
  <li>Proof read the content of your site.  Read the text on the web page and clean-up typos, missing punctuation, bad spacing, etc.  Remember this is intended to be a professional project.  You can use it later as part of your resume/portfolio.  However you won’t want to do that if it looks bad.</li>
</ul>
