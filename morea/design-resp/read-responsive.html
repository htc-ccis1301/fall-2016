  <h1 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h1>
<p>Read Chapter 8 of your textbook <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_felke_bwdHTML5_CSS3_3/">Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3</a> which covers responsive design using media queries.</p>

<p>Remember that you can get the example code from the book electronically from the <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_felke_bwdHTML5_CSS3_3/">textbook website</a>.  It is important to experiment with the material as you read and learn it so that you understand it well.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Chapter 8 begins with more information on hyperlinks, additional HTML5 elements, &amp; browser compatibility. However the main focus of the chapter is responsive design and CSS media queries. Make sure to spend time focused on understanding how these media queries function and how they are written. They make use of the CSS <em>cascade</em> to alter the applied CSS based on device size.</p>

<h2 id="links--more-html5">Links &amp; More HTML5</h2>

<h3 id="relative-and-fragment-links">Relative and Fragment Links</h3>
<p>It’s important to understand how relative paths work, as they are very common. With bigger web sites, the files are usually grouped into folders for organization, so when you reference one of those files, you need to include both the folder and file name.  Any link that does not begin with a / or a protocol (like http or ftp) is a relative link.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to forget that the path that you specify is relative to the location of the file that the link is in.  So sometimes you need to go up a folder level to get to the folder you want.  You can use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">..</code> in the path to indicate that you need to go up a level.  A single dot <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> can be used to indicate the current level, but usually this is just left off.</p>

<p>The following are equivalent:</p>

<p>       ./index.html</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>       index.html</p>

<p>Fragment identifiers are used to link to content further down your page.  This is great for information heavy sites like Wikipedia.  Check out the article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>.  There’s a lot of information there, but you can use the links in the Contents block near the top to skip down to the section you are interested in without scrolling.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the FAQ note at the end of this section. “Why don’t some of my hyperlinks to fragment identifiers work?”  The browser will try to position the content you link to at the top of the page, but if there is not enough content below it, then it may be visible on the page, but not at the top.</p>

<h3 id="figure-and-captions">Figure and Captions</h3>
<p>Check out the examples of adding captions to images, and the example of the image that is framed to look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_film">Polaroid</a>.  This can make a neat effect for images on a website, particularly if it is intended to look like a paper photo album.</p>

<h3 id="more-html5-elements">More HTML5 Elements</h3>
<p>The additional HTML5 elements for section, article, and aside should be used where they make sense to markup the content in an HTML5 site. Again, Wikipedia is a great example of where articles and sections make sense.  An online book is another great example, but it doesn’t have to be that literal.  We looked at some single page sites, where each <em>page</em> was something you scrolled to.  It might make sense for each of those <em>pages</em> to be a section.</p>

<p>The aside is commonly used to for <em>extra</em> content.  Things that are might be moved or hidden in certain contexts, perhaps a sidebar or part of a sidebar. Something that is related to the main content, but not integral to it.  There aren’t hard rules around the use of these additional elements, but you should try to use them in a way that is intuitive and makes sense for the content they contain.</p>

<h3 id="css-block-display--html5-shim">CSS Block Display &amp; HTML5 Shim</h3>
<p>One could easily spend an entire course discussing issues around browser compatibility.  The book only touches on some basics, and while I’ll point you to a few other resources, we’ll leave a lot of ground here untouched.  It’s a tricky topic for a class, as each browser has different issues and each version of the browser changes the features it supports.</p>

<p>The two browser compatibility fixes introduced in the textbook are simple snippets you can just add as part of a basic site template.  One snippet goes in your CSS file, the other on each HTML page.</p>

<p>Configure Block CSS:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">header</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">main</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">nav</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">footer</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">figure</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">figcaption</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">aside</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">section</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">article</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Configure HTML5 Shim in your HTML files:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  <span class="c">&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;![endif]--&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="print-css">Print CSS</h3>
<p>It’s great to have a spiffy and eye-catching layout for your web page, but what happens if someone wants to print that information?  There’s nothing more frustrating than finding the information you need, like that perfect brownie recipe, and then not being able to print it to take it with you.</p>

<p>If you have information someone may want to print, providing CSS for printing is both thoughtful and environmentally friendly.  By removing unnecessary content and streamlining your layout, you can ensure that the content prints neatly and with as little paper (and ink) wasted as possible.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-web--responsive-design">Mobile Web &amp; Responsive Design</h2>
<p>The use of media query to choose a specific stylesheet for mobile is one option to have a special site layout for mobile:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"mobile.css"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">"only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, the general trend leans more toward using one CSS file that uses media queries (and/or 3rd party libraries like Bootstrap) to customize the experience based on the available display size.  This is the approach we will be taking for the projects created for this course.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-first">Mobile First</h3>
<p>Since we already have a desktop site for our case study, we will use media queries to alter that view to have it display nicely on a smaller display. This not uncommon in practice, as historically most websites were initially made for and accessed on a computer. However, with the growing popularity of mobile devices this is increasingly untrue.</p>

<p>The popularity of mobile devices has been booming and these devices are now commonly used to browse the web.  In fact in many places throughout the world the only way for many people to access the web is from a mobile device.  Thus, a growing trend in web design is to design for smaller devices first.  You’ll hear this called “Mobile First Design”. Then once the mobile view of the site has been determined, they will enhance the layout and design for those who do use larger displays.</p>

<p>The case study will design for desktop first, but for our final portfolio project we will reverse this and design for mobile first.</p>

<h3 id="css-media-queries">CSS Media Queries</h3>
<p>We will be using media queries extensively throughout the remainder of the course.  It is very important that you understand both how add them into your CSS and the mechanics of how they work. Their intent is to alter the CSS applied to an element by overriding what was applied before.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example that just shows or hides an element based on the display size.  What would happen if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile-only</code> class were applied to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.mobile-only</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">none</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@media</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="n">screen</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max-width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">480px</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="nc">.mobile-only</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nl">display</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we apply the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile-only</code> class to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> element on our page, that <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> would be hidden when the display width was larger than 480px.  On a display with a width smaller than 480px, that <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> would be visible.</p>

<p>If you looked at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> using the developer tools, on a wide display, you would only see that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile-only</code> class was hiding the display. If you look at it on a mobile sized display, then you would see that the media query css was altering the behavior of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile-only</code> class by overriding the display and changing it from none to block.</p>

<p>Try it out and make sure that you understand how this works.</p>
