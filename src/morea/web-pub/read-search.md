## Search Engines
Search engines are an ever changing and deep topic, but if you intend to be part of web publishing, having a cursory understanding of how they work is important.  There are some simple basics that will go a long way, like the use of the description meta tag and basic accessibility features which also happen to support search engine bots.

Google provides a lot of resources that can help you to learn a bit more about how to set your site up to better support web search engines. They also have a nice and fairly short video (below) that gives a quick introduction.
