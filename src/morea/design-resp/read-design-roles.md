## Web Design Roles
In industry the web development is often split into two groups:  the designers & the developers.  The distinctions between the groups can often be blurred, with some people filling both roles, but it is common (especially with larger, commercial projects) to have both roles addressed separately.  On smaller projects however, it is not uncommon for one person to fill both roles, or to have the design tasks distributed throughout the team.

Web Designers, are often graphic designers who work with digital media.  They usually consider themselves as artists and are the creative inspiration behind the vision of the web site. They may also have an understanding of web specific issues, such as site usability, accessibility and responsive design, but this is not always the case. They to will often use wireframe tools to sketch out the design of a website, then use an art/design tool such as Photoshop, to paint a view of the website to *sell* that design concept to a customer.

User Experience Designers focus on how people interface with and interact with the web site. They  focus more strongly on site usability, navigation and site organization. They also have a good understanding of accessibility issues and considerations.They will often study how people use the site, perhaps presenting something one way to one group, and a different way to another to see which option gets the desired result.

Web Developers focus more on the technical skills and the building of the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and potentially other "back-end" programming languages such as Java, .Net, PHP or Python. They tend to work on larger interactive websites or web applications that store and present data and support business processes. They often have responsibilities for developing both the web user interface, as well as the back-end data systems. They may also work with various web content management systems to publish and maintain content.

In reality while there may be separate *ideal* roles, often these responsibilities are blended and blurred across a team.  Some people may do more artistic design, some may focus more on usability, others may focus more on writing the code.  But generally everyone has some expertise in one area, but some basic ability or knowledge of all. The smaller the project, the more roles one person must fill.
