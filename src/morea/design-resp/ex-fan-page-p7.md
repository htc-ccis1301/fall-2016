## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this assignment, you should be familiar with basic concepts of responsive design and how to make in page links to content.  This is reviewed in the reading for this module: [Responsive Design]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/design-resp/read-responsive.html ).


## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

Remember that once you have forked and cloned this repository, you do not need to do that again.  Just continue creating and editing files through Brackets and use the git add, commit, and push commands to update GitHub.


## Requirements
For this assignment, you will modify your fan site to have in-page links and a responsive layout.  

### Navigation
Configure a nav with a unordered list.  Have the first link go to your home page "index.html".  Use a short title or small image/logo to identify your "home page".  This link can be used to come back to the top of the page or return to the home page if other pages are added later.

Setup CSS to remove the underlines from your navigation links, slightly increase the font size, and specify different font colors (not the defaults) for visited and non-visited links.

You can choose to position the nav horizontally or vertically on your page, but add CSS to style the nav list so that it is not too crowded and is separated and distinct from the other content.

### In Page Links
Add additional structure to your main content area through the use of HTML5 article, section or aside elements.  

You should currently have your page set up with 4 sub-headings. If you do not have this, or have used heading tags for content that is not a heading, you will need to fix this first.  Separate each of your these sub-headings into its own HTML5 section (or article) element.  Give each section an id attribute and use that to add in-page links to your nav for each of the sections or sub-headings.


### Responsive Layout
Use CSS Media queries to adjust your desktop layout for better usability on tablet and mobile devices.  You should aim to have more empty space on the desktop and more vertically structured content on the smaller mobile devices.  You should see the layout shift as you reduce the width on your browser window to a tablet width and then again to a narrower mobile phone width.  

Your layout must be altered for each device size to get full points for this task.  Remember that in addition to moving or resizing content, you might also show or hide content as well.


### Responsive Design
Write a short 500-750 word paper (about 1-2 page) that discusses how you have altered your page layout to better support a variety of devices sizes and types.  You should include a paragraph that addresses changes for each desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Make sure to discuss the reasons for your changes. For example you might make changes for better visibility, larger click area, to conserve space, or to reduce bandwidth use or load time.


## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.


## Submit
Create a pull-request and submit your MS Word document write up along with the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture both the validator URL and the validator output in the validation screenshots.
