## Requirements
Locate a recent (no more than 1 year old) web article that discusses current web site design trends. This must be a blog post or a technical article.

{% include alert.html type="danger"
   content="The article must be no more than a year old. If there is no date information visible, look for another.  It must clearly be something published in the last year."
%}


Write a short 500-750 word paper (about 1-2 page) that identifies the article that you used (with a link) and gives a short summary of the trends and your thoughts on them.  You should also review the article itself. Was it good quality, well-written?  Does it seem like a quality source of information?

Make sure to include:

- a link to the article
- a summary and your thoughts on the current trends
- your thoughts on the article itself  

Note that you are graded on both the quality of your writing and the ideas in the paper.
