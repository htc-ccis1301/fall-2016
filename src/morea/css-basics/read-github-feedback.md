As part of the Student Directory assignment, you learned the basic workflow process that we will use for nearly all the assignments in this course.  It is very important that you understand and follow this process to get your assignments and have them graded correctly.

Submitting your pull request signals that the assignment is ready to be graded, so it is important that you complete this final step.  If there is no pull request submitted, the assignment will not be graded and you will not receive any credit for your work.

## Pull-request feedback
When your work is graded, all of the comments are added to the pull request in GitHub. This allows the comments to be tied directly to the lines of code that you have written.  You should be notified of the comments by email, depending on your GitHub settings, but it is generally more meaningful to look at those comments on the pull-request in GitHub as that gives you the context in which the comment was made.

The video below walks you through how to find and view this feedback.
