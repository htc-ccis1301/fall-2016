## Prerequisites
The following topics were covered earlier:

- [Basic CSS]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/css-basics/read-css-basics.html ): To complete this assignment you should be familiar with how CSS works and how to use it to alter the background and font colors on a web page.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
:dizzy: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you to have permission to use anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page <a href="http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/">http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/</a>.
</div>

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

Remember that once you have forked and cloned this repository, you do not need to do that again.  Just continue creating and editing files through Brackets and use the git add, commit, and push commands to update GitHub.


## Requirements
Add a new external stylesheet called style.css to your website project folder.

Update your index.html page to use your new stylesheet.

Update the HTML & CSS to have (at a minimum) the following items:

- a new document background color
- a new default document text color
- an alternate text color for one level of headings (h1, h2, etc.)
- a `<div>` with an id that is used to change the color of either the background or text of that element using CSS.
- a style class that is used to change the color of some text using a `<span>`

__All__ styles must be placed in the external stylesheet.  You should not include any CSS in your HTML page.  This is a general best practice as it supports easier maintenance of your web site.  Does it make sense to you why that might be true?

## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.

## Submit
Create a pull-request add a pull-request comment to include your thoughts on why it would make maintenance of a web site easier to keep all styles in an external CSS file and out of the HTML files.

Submit the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request with comment
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture both the validator URL and the validator output in the validation screenshots.
