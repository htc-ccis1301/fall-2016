# {{ page.title }}
For this assignment, you will search the web for an article that discusses and demonstrates a CSS technique.  The tutorial must be recent, published in the last 2 years, and should be different than something covered in the textbook Hands on Practices that we have seen.

## Prerequisites
To complete this assignment you will need:

- a solid understanding of HTML and CSS from the previous modules
- a new GitHub repository, created as shown in the reading [More Git & GitHub]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/more-css/read-more-git.html )


## GitHub
You will create a new GitHub repository for this assignment. You may name it as you like, but must post a screenshot of the repository and the live webpage to the dropbox to receive credit for the assignment.

Remember: You must push your work to the __gh-pages__ branch for it to be visible as a live website on GitHub.

## Requirements
Locate a recent (no more than 2 year old) web article that demonstrates a new CSS technique. This must be a blog post or a technical article, **NOT** a just an entire CSS tutorial such as this [W3Schools CSS Borders](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp).

### Find an article
Some examples of what I have in mind:

- [How to code a blog theme concept in HTML and CSS](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-code-a-blog-theme-concept-in-html-css)
- [12 Awesome CSS3 Features You Can Finally Use](http://tutorialzine.com/2013/10/12-awesome-css3-features-you-can-finally-use/)
- [Techniques for Textured Text](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/12/02/techniques-for-creating-textured-text/)

__Note that you cannot use these.__ Do you see why?  It's not just because I linked them...

### Apply what you learn
Create an HTML page to show that you have applied what you learned from the article. As always, you should double check that your page is valid using the W3C Validators.

Write a README.md file (see the ones for the previous assignments as examples) for your repository.  This file must:

- Identify the article that you used (with a link)
- Summarize what you learned from the article (1-2 paragraphs)
- Review the article.  (2-3 paragraphs) You will need to say more than just it was good or bad. Explain clearly what you liked or didn't like about the article and how easy or hard it was to learn from their tutorial.


## Submit the Assignment
Creating a new repository and pushing changes to it is a key part of this assignment.  Because you are not forking an existing class repository, you can not create a pull request for me.

When complete, you must post a screenshot of the repository and the live webpage to the assignment box on D2L to receive credit for the assignment. If you do not include the screenshots, you will get no credit for this work.  

Submit the following to the Assignment box on D2L:

- A screenshot of your repository page on GitHub.  Make sure this shows your username & the repository name.
- A screenshot of your site published on the web.  Make sure the screenshot clearly shows the URL for your site.
