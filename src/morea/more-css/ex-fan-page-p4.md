{% include alert.html type="warning" content="As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you to have permission to use anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [Guild Wars 2 Boss Timer](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/)"
%}

Add at least two more subheadings (for a total of four) to your page. Each subheading should have text and/or image content following it.

Update your external CSS file to include (at a minimum) the following items:

- Use padding on the main elements to set the content away from the edges (element border)
- Add a background gradient to the body using CSS
- Set one level of headings to have a transparent background-color
- Add padding (at least top & bottom) to the heading with the transparent background-color
- Add rounded corners to the heading with the transparent background-color
