## Colors
A colorful site might jump out at you, but imagine if [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) were as colorful as [Nickelodeon](http://www.nick.com/).  Again, color should tie to purpose and your target audience, but there are technical aspects to color as well.  For example, choosing colors with sufficient contrast is important for usability.

There are also accessibility concerns around colors. Your should also ensure that your site information can be clearly conveyed to those who cannot see the colors clearly or cannot see them at all.  Pay particular attention to this with things like alert boxes or panels where you may easily assume the color of the panel - green is OK, yellow is caution, red is warning - conveys a special meaning. It is important to have a secondary means of communicating that information such as an icon or specialized screen-reader text.

Finally, colors can be used artistically to set the tone and mood of your site, but some color combinations work better together than others.  A full study of color and design is outside the scope of this course, but if you are interested in learning more you can visit [Colors on the Web](http://www.colorsontheweb.com/).

### Designing a Color Scheme
Even the most basic website will use color and making bad choices can leave an unpleasant impression with those that visit the site.  A little thought to color will go a long way toward making a usable site and making a good impression with your site visitors.  However, those of us who are not artists likely need some help with this, and fortunately sites like [Paletton - the Color Scheme Designer](http://paletton.com/) are here to rescue us.

In some of your assignments, I will ask you to link to a color scheme you've designed on Paletton.  This video will walk you through using Paletton, and shows you where to get a custom link you can use to return to the color scheme you've designed.

### 60 30 10 Rule
A standard of web design, which originates in interior design, is the 60-30-10 rule.  It should be applied both to the spacing of your web content and your use of colors.

For colors, a standard to begin with is to have:

- 60% use of the primary site color
- 30% use of a secondary color
- 10% use of an accent color

This gives a balanced and cohesive look to your site.


### Current trends in color
What is trendy on the web changes fairly continuously, but it never hurts to at least be aware of what is current in web fashion:
