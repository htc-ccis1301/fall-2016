## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this assignment, you should be familiar with the two-column page layout and how to use CSS for positioning elements.  This is reviewed in the reading:  [Page Layout]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/page-layout/read-page-layout.html ).


## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

Remember that once you have forked and cloned this repository, you do not need to do that again.  Just continue creating and editing files through Brackets and use the git add, commit, and push commands to update GitHub.


## Requirements
For this assignment, you will clean up the design of your fan-page and give it a respectable color palette and design that reflects the content of your site. Consider your topic, and then consider your target audience who will be either:

1. Someone else sharing that interest.
2. Someone using your site to decide if you have the skills to make a professional looking site.

Recognize that these audiences may conflict with each other and aim for a happy middle ground. Though you can certainly lean strongly towards group 1, make sure you do not completely forget about group 2.

## Site design clean-up
You want to aim for a professional looking site. The goal is for this to become a part of your web portfolio. You want to have a site that you are proud to show off to others.

Some of the things that you were asked to do earlier may be preventing your site from looking its best.  So you are now free to undo any of the HTML/CSS I required you to add earlier just for the sake of illustrating that you can do particular tasks.  

However you __must__ maintain a solid HTML5 structural layout to your site.  This means you must keep a header, nav, main content area, and footer.  


### Color Palette
You will need to create a color palette using the [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) website and add a link to that color palette in your footer.  (The Paletton video in the reading shows how to get a link to your palette, not just the site itself.)

Aim to adjust your color use to follow the 60-30-10 rule.

You also need to ensure at least a contrast ratio of 3:1 between your background and text colors.  (The Paletton video in the reading shows how you can view the contrast ratio between various colors in your chosen color scheme.)


### Spacing and Layout
You may also want to clean-up your spacing a bit with the addition of the HTML5 articles or sections. A good tip for simplifying your spacing is to consistently add margin to only the top or the bottom of elements.  You still want to aim for that 60-30-10 rule where about 60% of your space on a desktop layout is empty or negative space.

Using more generous vertical spacing between articles/sections can help add to a single scrolling page feel and move you toward that 60% open space goal.  In the next module, we will update this design for mobile phones, so there the space can be collapsed.  Aim to give the desktop site a more open and spacious feel.


## Design Write-up
Write a short (500-700 word) paper discussing your target audience, the reasons for selecting the color palette you chose, and how you considered the 60-30-10 rule and other web design best practices in the clean-up of your fan page website.


## Note on Grading
This week's requirements are a lot more open than in previous weeks and the grading will be a bit more subjective.  I will look specifically for the color palette and contrast, but the remaining points will be based on how well you have designed your site to look professional and illustrate principles from the text as well as the 60-30-10 rule.


## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.


## Submit
Create a pull-request and submit your MS Word document write up along with the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture both the validator URL and the validator output in the validation screenshots.
