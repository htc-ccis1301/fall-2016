## Design Review
Using the information on web design provided in Chapter 3 of your textbook and the notes on this site, you will review one of the websites from the list below. The specific site for you to review is based on the first letter of your last name.

- A-C:  www.arm.gov                      
- D-G:  www.sedonalibrary.org  
- H-K:  www.alistapart.com     
- L-N:  www.dcmm.org
- O-R:  www.japantimes.co.jp
- S-U:  www.ideamatic.net
- V-Z www.telework.gov

## Review the Site
Look at the site and evaluate your assigned site against the design best practices discussed in the textbook and website notes.  Some questions to consider as you explore the site:


- What was your initial reaction to the site?
- Did your thoughts on the site change after spending some time navigating the site and looking over the content?
- What do you like or dislike about the site? Can you tie those to the design practices in the checklist at the end of chapter 3?
- Who do you believe to be the site's target audience?
- Do you think the site appeals to that audience? Give concrete reasons for why or why not.


## Review Document
Formalize your thoughts in a short 800-1000 word paper (about 2 pages) that covers your thoughts on the web site design. You should try to ensure that your paper is neither too long or too short, however clarity and inclusion of all the required points is equally important.

The paper will be graded both on your understanding of web design principles and the presentation of those ideas in your writing. Correct spelling and grammar should be used, and attention should be paid to the organization of your ideas.  

It is important that you keep this review polite and professional. Imagine the review is for the site owners and developers.  Phrase any *suggestions* for improvement in a professional way that shows respect for the business owners and site designers.  Imagine that they are considering hiring you to refine and improve their site.  You want to show you have good ideas based on solid reasoning, but you also need to not offend them or they'll likely hire someone else. Illustrate opportunities for improvement in a professional and positive light.

While you have a lot of freedom in your review, there are a few things you must specifically include:

- An introduction to the site and its purpose
- An brief discussion of the site's target audience and how the may appeal (or not) to that audience
- Focus the main content on a discussion of how the site measures up against good design practices
  - Discuss at least 6 specific items from the reading and web notes
  - Identify how these items improve or hinder the site's usability and appeal
  - Select at least 3 things that the site does well  
  - Identify 2-3 things that you feel could be done better
- Discuss the overall experience of the site for a mobile device user (is the site responsive?)
- Conclude the paper with a summary of your overall thoughts on the site design.
