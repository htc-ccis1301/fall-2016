## Web Design - Wireframes, Mockups, & Prototypes
Generally the initial discussions of web site design results in the creation of a simple sketch of the layout. This is often a simple black and white line drawing on paper. At this phase, many changes occur to the design, and the design is usually evolving too rapidly to vest much time into details. A very simple wireframe example is shown in your textbook for the case study layouts. (See Figure 7.40 on page 241 for an example.)

As more information and details of the design are discussed and determined, these wireframes are refined into a more detailed mockup that shows a clearer picture of what the site will look like. There is a lot of variety in what people consider a mockup. This can include everything from a more detailed sketch on paper to a highly detailed Photoshop image of what the final site will look like.

Mockups are also used to communicate design choices for colors. Even pencil sketch mockups will usually include information on the colors to be used for the site. Clients tend to care greatly about the color scheme selected, as it is usually is tied into branding and has a large impact on the feel of the site.

Prototypes expand on this further by making the mockup interactive and live.  The basic site is developed with HTML & CSS, often using generic content such as [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) text and block placeholder images.  Since this is a live website, it can illustrate interactive effects, such as scrolling images, tabbed content, or animations that could not be as easily shown on paper.

Regardless of the level of detail, it is important that the customer can look at the wireframe or mockup and immediately understand the design. The basic layout of key pieces of content and functionality should be clear even in the most basic wireframe. Clear communication of the design and intent is key to customer satisfaction.
