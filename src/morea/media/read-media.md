Read Chapter 11 of your textbook [Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3](http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_felke_bwdHTML5_CSS3_3/) which covers building and styling tables on the web.  

Remember that you can get the example code from the book electronically from the [textbook website](http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_felke_bwdHTML5_CSS3_3/).  It is important to experiment with the material as you read and learn it so that you understand it well.

## Overview
Chapter 11 introduces media file types for audio and video.  Using media on your web pages can make them both more interesting and informative, but it is important to add them in a manner appropriate to your site.  The content should support the website's purpose. Also, remember that many visitors can be turned away by audio and video that plays automatically.  

## Media File Types
It is important to realize that there is currently no one way to get media on the web in a way supported by all browsers.  It is important to provide alternate file types and encodings to obtain broad support and accessibility.  When using HTML5 video and audio, remember to provide appropriate fallbacks for browsers that lack HTML5 support.

## CSS Transform & Transition
This chapter also includes information on using CSS to transform elements on your web pages.  This can be used to rotate and scale images, text or other page elements.  Rotation of elements in particular can be used to a great effect to call attention to elements on your page.

CSS transitions can also be added to gradually alter the display of items. They can be applied to color, background-color, border, font-size, font-weight, margin, padding, opacity and text-shadow.  These can be used in various ways to add interest and interactivity to your web pages.

## CSS Dropdown Menu
CSS Dropdown menus are convenient choices for web navigation as they do not rely on having JavaScript enabled in the browser.  While many sites will use JavaScript or other framework components (i.e. Bootstrap) for navigation, this is a great demonstration of how basic CSS skills that you now know can be used to build interactive components for your web site.
