## Outline
To get some initial feedback on your developing portfolio site, you may optionally submit an outline of the site focusing mainly on HTML and Bootstrap. This is intended to get you some early help using Bootstrap if it is needed, as well as a preliminary review of your site layout and design.  The more you have done, the more I can review and give you feedback on.

Consider what we did with Ms. B's website.  It looked pretty ho-hum and standard, right up until that last few minutes as we started tweaking the CSS.  Get the HTML foundation in place, use default Bootstrap components, and later work on adding the detailed content and making the style unique.

Try not to get too caught up in the content itself as you build the site outline.  Use [Lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) text if needed to avoid getting caught up writing. Use placeholder images, or just a `<div>` with a size, fill and "Image TBD" text for now.  The details can come later.  

## HTML5 Elements
Make sure that you are using HTML5 structural tags to outline your site.  You should have at a minimum, the nav, main,  article or section tags (for each of the required content sections), and a footer.  The header is not necessary, as it is generally incorporated into the Bootstrap nav.  You may include a separate header if you wish, so long as it doesn't interfere with the Bootstrap nav and scrollspy behavior.

## Submit for Feedback
To received feedback on this outline, a pull-request must be made before the due date with a screenshot submitted to the assignment box on D2L. Any pull-requests submitted after the due date or without a screenshot in the assignment box on D2L are not guaranteed to be reviewed.
