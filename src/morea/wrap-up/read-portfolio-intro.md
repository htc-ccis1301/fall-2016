# {{ page.title }}
This final project is intended to show everything that you have learned over the course.  A failure to complete the project will result in a large drop in your final grade for the course. (See the course syllabus for details.)  

It is also intended that you should be able to maintain this website and use it as an online resume or portfolio as you begin looking for a job.  It is strongly recommended that you continue to use GitHub as a repository for all of your course content so that you can link to this work on your portfolio and resume.  Having an active GitHub profile that shows what you are learning and what you know can be a huge asset in your future job search.


## GitHub Project Repository
The initial repository for this project can be found on our class organization page:

[fall2016-portfolio](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fall2016-portfolio)


## Overview
Think of this portfolio as your online resume. The site will be made using Bootstrap, using the principles of mobile first design.  Plan first how this will look on a phone (never know who you'll bump into at a coffee shop) and then enhance it for a desktop. Bootstrap will help you to do this as it is "mobile first".

You are free to customize the look of the site to suit your own taste and style, and in fact is it is meant to showcase your style and personality. No two of these final projects should look alike. However, you must include the information required below. Make yourself a checklist and double-check that you do not miss something along the way.


## Site Requirements
The site must contain all of the information below __on a *single* page__.  If you wish to include additional pages with additional supporting information, you can do that. However I must be able to find all of the key information below on the main page.


### Required Content
Your site __must__ include the following content:

- Your full name
- A short intro or personal statement (No more than 3 sentences. who are you, what kind of job do you want, etc)
- Link to your GitHub profile using one of Font Awesome's icons for GitHub.
- Same page navigation links to each of the following sections:
  - Section for Technical skills (at the very least you can use a computer and know HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap)
  - Section for Projects (see below)
  - Section for Education (include school(s), degree(s)/program(s) and a list of relevant courses)
- Footer w/ copyright, link to a Paletton color scheme, and optionally an email.

You may optionally also include the following:

- A professional looking picture of yourself (they say it helps leave a good impression)
- Section for Work/Volunteer Experience
- Additional Social Media Links (LinkedIn is a good choice, add others only if you consider your content there professional)


### Project Section
The project section must include a gallery featuring your class projects.  At a minimum you should include 3 projects from this course - your fan page, the Pacific Trails case study, and Ms B's Veggies.  You might also choose to include other pages from the weekly assignments or additional course work from other classes.  

Each HTML project should have an image screenshot that links to the project's live web page hosted on GitHub. There should also be a caption that links to the GitHub repository page that shows all the files in the repository.  For any non-HTML projects you choose to include, you may list them separately as only text linking to GitHub, or you may include them in the gallery with your HTML projects by using an image that links directly to the GitHub repository files.  


### Required Bootstrap components
You __must__ use the following Bootstrap components when creating your portfolio site:

- [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) - with links to each required section
- [ScrollSpy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy)
- [Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) - used for responsive site layout instead of custom media queries

As you are designing the look and feel of your site, you will want to consider how these components will effect the layout and display of your website.

## Project Submissions
The project is broken up into three parts:

- Wireframe design
- Prototype HTML outline (optional)
- Final site submission

The due dates for each part are on the assignment boxes on D2L.  

Make sure to get started on the work early.  Many students underestimate the effort required for this project.
