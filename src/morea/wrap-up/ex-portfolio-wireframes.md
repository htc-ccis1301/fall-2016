## Site Design Contract
To get full credit for your portfolio project, you must submit wireframes that show how you intend to design your site.  These should be created up-front, before you actually build your website, as that is the intent of *design*.  

Failure to submit the wireframes will result in a 25% reduction in your overall final project grade.

## Grading
This assignment is worth 25 points and will be graded as follows:

- Mobile design - 10 points
- Tablet design - 5 points
- Desktop design - 10 points

Each design layout should reflect the use of the required Bootstrap components and make good use of the available space.  Remember to apply the 60-30-10 rule and good web design best practices.


## Wireframes
For the first part of the assignment, you will sketch out your site in a wireframe.  You may use whatever tool you like for this, including pen/paper, but you must submit the completed wireframes to the assignment box on D2L.  (Make good scans or photos if you use pen/paper.)  There are several specialized tools you could try for free, or you can use tools like PowerPoint or Visio.

Make sure to consider what you have learned about the look and feel of Bootstrap in the creation of your wireframes. The more you try to alter their standard components display the harder this project will be.  In particular, make sure to allow for how their nav bar will display in the design of your site's navigation and header.

You must include a wireframe showing the mobile view, a tablet view and a desktop view. The wireframes do not need to be highly detailed, but they should clearly show each section you plan to include on your page with appropriate headings, outlines of where text and images will be used, and how the overall layout will be designed.  As examples, you might use a box with an X to represent an image, and squiggly lines to represent text.  


## Submit for Feedback
To submit your wireframes you will need to submit them electronically to the assignment box on D2L. Please clearly name them to reflect the device size.  You should have one for mobile, one for tablet and one for desktop.  

The assignment box will remain open throughout the project to allow for wireframe updates, but after initial feedback is given, you should discuss any changes with me before making them. It is not acceptable to just decide at the last minute to alter the design because you couldn't get it to work right.
