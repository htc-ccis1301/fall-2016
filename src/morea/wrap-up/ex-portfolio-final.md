## Grading
This assignment is worth 75 points and will be graded as follows:

- All HTML and CSS files are valid - 10 points (all or nothing)
- Mobile site presentation (matches wireframes) - 10 points
- Tablet & desktop layout (matches wireframes) - 10 points
- Required personalize information including IT skills & education - 5 points
- Portfolio Gallery - 10 points
- Custom CSS (colors, fonts, margins, padding, etc.) - 10 points
- Bootstrap Navbar and ScrollSpy used with links to HTML5 articles/sections - 10 points
- Use of Icon Font & Link to Color Palette - 5 points
- Appropriate use of Bootstrap CSS - 5 points


## Custom Style
Utilize the resources available to you to select a custom color palette, fonts and icons.  Use [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) or a similar site to make a color palette and add a link to that in your footer.  Use [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) to browse and select one or two fonts, setting up appropriate font family properties to ensure good fallback fonts. Optionally use custom bullets with images or icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) or [Bootstrap Glypicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

I would recommend that you take the same approach that we used to customize Ms. B's Veggies, and set up your own stylesheet to add and alter styles as needed.  While it is possible to [customize Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) for download, this process for this can be a little overwhelming and time intensive, especially while you are still finalizing your choices.


## Feedback & Polish
Make sure that you've acted on any feedback received earlier, as a failure to do so will likely result in a lower overall score.  You might also share your site in the class chat to get feedback from others. You might be nervous about sharing, but remember everyone is in the same position here and because of that it's probably one of the most friendly groups you'll ever get feedback from.

Ensure your main page looks polished, professional and complete. Make sure to proof read carefully, and then have someone else proof read for you. This is your online resume, spelling, grammar, and punctuation all make an impression.  Make sure it will be a good one.

Please use Beautify to help format your code for readability before turning it in. Clear and consistent use of indentation helps prevent errors in development and allows me to give better feedback on your work.  


## Test & Validate
Check your page locally (on your computer) by viewing it in the browser, paying particular attention to any differences intended between the mobile, tablet, and desktop presentation.  Verify that all of your navigation links work and that your headings are not hidden under the nav bar.  Check that your site matches your wireframes.  Remember that is our design contract.

Make sure that you have included all of the required content!

Test validate, then test and validate again just to be sure it's all great.  This is your final chance to review the site before submitting it for your final grade.  


## Push to GitHub & Test Again
When everything looks good, add & commit your changes then push your files up to GitHub.  Verify your changes have been pushed, then test your updated site on the web by clicking on the URL under settings.  

Retest your page on the web, checking page layout and verifying links again. (Case-sensitivity can break links here that work when you test on locally on Windows!)  

Paste the URL from your live page (not the GitHub view of the text) into the W3C Validators to validate your page on the web by URI instead of file upload.  This is what I will do to grade your work, so it's an extra precaution that you don't lose a large chunk of points due to validation errors.


## Submit the Assignment
When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded, and then celebrate. You're all done!  :dancer:
