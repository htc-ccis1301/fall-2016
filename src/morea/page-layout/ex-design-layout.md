## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this assignment, you should be able to recognize and outline a website's page layout.  This is reviewed in the reading:  [Page Layout Design]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/page-layout/read-design-layout.html).


## Requirements
For this assignment, you will review a series of internet sites and discuss their page layout. Create a MS Word document that lists each site and includes:

- screenshots of the page viewed on a desktop, tablet & mobile sized device
- a block layout diagram of their desktop page layout (indicate if it matches a pattern from the reading)
- a paragraph that discusses how that layout is altered for a tablet and/or mobile device

For the screenshots, just adjust the width of your browser window. You do not need an actual tablet or phone.  As the display narrows, the layout will shift.

You will need to create a block illustration of their page layout structure. You can do this block diagram using pen & paper and then scan or photo it, or you may use a tool such as Visio, Powerpoint or even MS Paint which allows you to draw basic shapes on a computer.  Whatever tool you choose, you must include an image of that block layout inside the MS Word document for submission.

## Websites
Many of these sites have a long scrolling page.  Make sure to scroll down to include the full page layout in your diagram. Note that if sections of blocks repeat, you can include 2-3 rows and note that they repeat instead of drawing the same blocks repeatedly.  However, make sure to scroll to the bottom and include any footer or end content of the page in your diagram.
