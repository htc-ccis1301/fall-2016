## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this assignment, you should be familiar with the page layout and design topics covered in the reading:   

- [Page Layout]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/page-layout/read-page-layout.html )
- [Page Layout Design]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/page-layout/read-design-layout.html )


## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

Remember that once you have forked and cloned this repository, you do not need to do that again.  Just continue creating and editing files through Brackets and use the git add, commit, and push commands to update GitHub.


## Requirements
For this assignment, you will modify your fan site to have a fixed header and a spacious layout.  

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you to have permission to use anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [Guild Wars 2 Boss Timer](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/)"
%}


### Fixed header
Add CSS to make the header take the full page width and fix the header at the top of the page so that when you scroll, the header does not move.  

Add a margin to the top of your main content so that it does not get hidden under the header.  

If you are having problems with this, try a web search for help on how to work with a fixed header.  Prioritize answers from sites like StackOverflow or Mozilla, but don't just copy paste, make sure to read and understand what they are suggesting and adjust the answers to work on your site's layout.


### Layout and Spacing
Adjust the spacing (padding and margins) throughout your site to allow open space between your content.  Aim for the 60-30-10 rule, where 60% of the page layout is open or negative space.

Be careful with the use of images so that they do not make the site look too cluttered.  When using full page background images, you might cover over parts of them to give your main content a solid background and some open or negative space.  An alternate approach would be to limit the image to a portion of the page, similar to the hero image in the case study, though you should not feel restricted to having that image be at the top of the page.  It might also fit nicely along the side, middle, or bottom.

### Float something
Use CSS to float something on the page either right or left of some other content.  Remember that the order of the elements is important with float. If you are not getting the look you want, you may need to swap the order.  (Refer back to the examples from the textbook if needed.)


## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.


## Submit
Create a pull-request and submit the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture both the validator URL and the validator output in the validation screenshots.
