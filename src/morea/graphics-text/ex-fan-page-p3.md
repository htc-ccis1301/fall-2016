## Requirements
For this assignment, you will continue work with your fan site.  

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you to have permission to use anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [Guild Wars 2 Boss Timer](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/)"
%}
